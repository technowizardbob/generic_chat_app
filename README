LANCHAT - My very first attempts at a generic WINPOPUP 'ish like client for Linux...

# Made in Go.

## Server seems okay...but the Client needs work.

Lots of bugs: 
[ ] 1) Lanchat crashes at times with a segfault.
[ ] 2) Does not have full Focus when poping up on new message.
[ ] 3) Does not list old messages. 
[ ] 4) Will only show/exchange messages to currently connected users....
[ ] 5) Needs a Scroll Window, so TreeView Chat stays inside of the Window!
[ ] 6) Client does not reconnect gracefully.

### Be sure to update the conf.yaml files to allow access...

To modify the GUI have Glade installed:
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt -y install glade
```
